The "QPULSECAPTURE" application was designed
for contactless heart rate measurements by
means of an web cam. In addition it provides
an option to record signal, that can be
interpreted as photoplethysmogram from face
skin.  

Accuracy examination shows that for indoor
environment (fluorescent lamps, object
luminosity about 100 lux) and webcam
Logitech C270 absolute error was ± 5 bpm
in region from 60 to 99 bpm (refer to
commercial pulse oximeter device).

System requirements:
  - AMD or Intel CPU with 2 cores and 2.6 GHz clock speed (or higher);
  - 512 Mb of RAM (or higher);
  - A webcam 0,3 Mpx (or higher, Logitech is better).
