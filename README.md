QPULSECAPTURE
=============

  This project had been created as next step of "Pulse capture" (an application,
that provides heart and respiration rates measurements by means of a web cam on PC).
This time We have tried to use libraries with GNU GPL and BSD licenses only - OpenCV
for video processing tasks, and Qt for GUI and threads managment. So, We hope that
source code will be helpful for those, who want to integrate a power of OpenCV
library in to the Qt based application.

  For developers:
    - all dependencies are provided in Sources.pro;
    - an application is properly builded in Qt-creator_5.2.1 with OpenCV_2.4.8 with
    MSVC2010x32 compiller, the other configurations were not tested yet;
    - WVCF_utility is optional (see HEAD in WVCF_utility.cpp).
